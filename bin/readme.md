## FFmpeg binaries

To make installation and running as easy as possible, fflipper comes with FFmpeg binaries for the correct release architecture. These are both the versions used by (and the approach inspied by) the [ffmpeg-static](https://osxexperts.net) project. They have been unmodified from the original FFmpeg source. The FFmpeg source for the matching version is included with this repo to ensure even if the other sources go away, this one remains.

FFmpeg is license is (L)GPL depending on what files are included (see the LICENSE.md and COPYING.GPLv2 inside the source directory for more details).
